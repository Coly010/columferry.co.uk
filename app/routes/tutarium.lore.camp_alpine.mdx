### What is it?
	- A small settlement made up of multiple groups of families who joined together many years go for survival.
	- They used to travel, trading goods in towns to gather gold for purchases of things that they cannot make or hunt for.

### Where is it?
	- Currently situated in **Southern Mountains**

### Hierarchy
	- **Leader** - **Gregory Hunt**
	- **Leader's Wife** - **Yvonne Hunt**

### Background
	- Founded by **Calin Stone**, **Jaelyn Stone** and **George Leoge**.
	- They lived in **Nordip**, but the King at the time was setting and increasing absurd taxes and it became infeasible for them to continue to live there.
	- They gathered up some belongings and set out to live off the land, camping in different locations every few days
	- After a while they realised they needed gold to make up for shortfalls in their skills
		- They would do odd jobs to earn gold when they were near settlements
	- Soon, more and more people joined them, needing a way to escape taxes and poorer quality of lives.
	- More people meant more skills and soon they no longer needed to work odd jobs. Instead they crafted and built goods that they could sell.
	- Organisation soon sprang up in the camp as responsibilities became more important

#### Warriors/Hunters
		- Same group of people. A mix of men and women who were useful with weapons.

#### Builders
		- In charge of taking down and setting up camp when they travelled to a new location. Most families contributed at least one member to be a builder.
		- Some builders were also in charge of manufacturing tools, weapons, furniture and other trinkets that could be used or sold

#### Cooks/Healers
		- In charge of preparing food that could be shared among the members.
		- Also in charge of providing medical aid to any who felt unwell or had suffered injuries

#### Teachers
		- Taught what they could to the younger members of camp
			- Life skills
			- Survival skills
			- Academia related knowledge
		- Access to books was limited to start with, but it grew over time until a small library was accumulated
			- In fact, for a while, some of the camp gold was budgeted for purchasing new books

#### Leader
		- In charge of the bigger decisions but usually consulted with the other members of the camp before making them.
		- They handled
			- When and where to travel
			- How to concentrate effort for gathering gold
			- How to budget and spend gold
			- What was a focus for teaching
	- Under **Gregory Hunt**'s leadership, many of the women found themselves pregnant, including his wife **Yvonne Hunt**, and he accepted that the camp could not keep travelling,
		- The families needed more stability in their lives at this time
		- The pregnant women were unable to travel as easily
		- The newborns needed constant attention and could not be travelled
	- Therefore, he set them up in a more permanent in the **Southern Mountains**
