It's finally happening. After years of writing, rewriting, and pouring everything into this story, **The Rise of Demons** is complete and pre-orders are now live!

The book will officially publish on **1st March 2026**, but you can secure your copy right now on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0GHSTMYXY).

This has been an incredible journey — from a single character's perspective to three interwoven storylines, from early drafts to the finished product. I can't wait for you all to step into Tutarium and discover what lurks beneath the surface.

Thank you to everyone who has followed along with these updates. This one's for you.
