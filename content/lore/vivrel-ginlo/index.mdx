## Lore

### How he came to be at the Council

He had been a foot soldier after he had completed his mage training. He fought in some minor skirmishes doing peacekeeping duty working his way to rank of Captain. At this point, he had enough of fighting, sickened by the copious death tolls, including his own personal kill count

He left, deciding that he wanted to heal, not kill. He approached the Healing Sanctuary of Onaem and asked if could train in their ways. He didn't meet their usual requirements but given his background they allowed it. Here he trained for six years before being given his assignment, to be the Healer in Blusix. He went there and it was a peaceful assignment for all of three years

Shortly after his 42nd Name Day, a human army appeared along the banks of the Eastborne River.

#### Defence of Blusix

A fortnight later, the human army attacked the dwarven settlement, hoping to claim the town for its wealth and riches. The dwarves fought back and the battle dragged on. Weeks turned to months, with no sign of ceasefire or peace agreement. Both sides took heavy damages.

Vivrel had to set up a makeshift hospital, clumsily train some dwarven healers and they set about healing as many of the dwarven soldiers as they could.
Healing Supplies were running dangerously low.

Vivrel convinced the King to send a messenger to Knilaz, to reach one of the Council's couriers to ask for assistance in ending the battle. The king was not impressed at the idea of asking elves for help, but his people were suffering badly and he recognised that this battle needed to end before the casualty count continued to rise.

Two months later a battalion from the Grand Elven Army appeared. They sent messengers to both the humans and to the dwarf king stating their purpose and what their hope was. A meeting was set up between the King and leader of the humans, right in the centre of the battlefield, hosted by Alinar himself, a Commander at the time.

Both sides arrived with an honour guard of soldiers. Alinar was by himself. The king also invited Vivrel along.
The talks did not go well.

In the end the human leader drew his sword and rammed it through Alinar's stomach, his patience at the elf's insistence that the conflict be settled finally reaching an end. The dwarven company retaliated, attacking the humans, but the humans had an advantage of numbers. It seemed like the King himself would be slaughtered.

Vivrel took Alinar's sword and amulet, checked the energy substance and replenished it with some Liloto petals, then he got involved in the battle. Vivrel had the training, and the upper hand with being a mage. He slew all but one of the humans including their leader. The survivor he sent back to the human army as a messenger, telling him to convey that their leader was dead, if they wanted to live, to return to their homes.

Vivrel, with the help of the dwarves took Alinar back to the hospital. Vivrel operated on and healed Alinar, saving his life. Alinar returned to the elven army, who marched back to Flinton. The humans had also retreated.

#### Appointment to Grand Elven Council

Twenty three years later Alinar became The Zaetorum of the Council.
At this point, Vivrel had ceased working as a Healer in Blusix, replaced by the next healer, a dwarf this time who Vivrel had recommended, who needed to complete their assignment.

Instead Vivrel had taken to more scholarly activities. Reading, writing, researching and travelling to learn more things. He had published some thought pieces based on his experience both within the army and as a healer.

It was a further eight years before the position of Protector of the Realm needed to be filled. Alinar had asked Vivrel to meet with him, to dine with him. During this meal Alinar expressed his gratitude to Vivrel for saving his life all those years ago, a debt that he felt he could not repay.

He mentioned that Vivrel had the aptitude and skill of a commander, yet the caring nature and abilities of a Master Healer, with the appetite of a scholar. It made him the perfect person to fill the role of Protector of the Realm, to protect the people from old threats and new, the known and the unknown. Truly protect, not as a military commander would protect simply by ensuring the battle was won. By helping to push policy and strategies that would indeed make a difference that could lead to a more peaceful society.

Vivrel accepted.
