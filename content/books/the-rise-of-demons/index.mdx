Demons don’t exist. At least, that is what the world believes.

When two relics vanish from The Vault of Osgrua, the lie begins to strain. No gold is taken. No jewels. Only artefacts the Grand Elven Council insists are harmless.

Across the realm, three lives are already under pressure.

Vivrel Ginlo is chasing a truth that has cost him more than most would risk.
Calilas Larethan is navigating a city where power hides in shadows.
Marcella is learning what survival demands when no one is watching.

As whispers of unworldly black fire spread and The Essence begins to behave in ways it never has before, the past presses against the present.

Some truths are buried to protect the world.
Some truths are too dangerous.

The Rise of Demons is Book One of The Dark War Trilogy.
